This project aims to find the minimum perturbation on an image to force a Deep Neural Network classifier to misclassify that image.
We have used a simple DNN for this and are treating it as a black box to find techniques for finding the minimum perturbation.

contains:
DNN.py - the deep neural network model

demo.py - module for running the DNN and when run contains a demo for image 00000/00000_0000.ppm

images_* - these folders are full of the images used to train the model these are sourced from the institute for neuroinformatics http://benchmark.ini.rub.de
